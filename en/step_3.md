## Drawing sprites and a backdrop

In this project, I will be translating from my first language, English , into other languages and using the English flag. If your first language is available in both the translate and text to speech extensions, donâ€™t hesitate to use it instead.

To start, open the [starter project](resources/PhrasebookStarter.sb3)

Next, create the main backdrop. The first backdrop will contain flags to represent the languages we will be using.
Use the button in the bottom right corner to choose a backdrop.

Choose a backdrop from the library or create your own. I chose Wall 1.

Next you will add a flag sprite. The Spanish flag is already provided. Now draw the England flag, it is a white flag with a red cross in the middle. Mine is below.
