## More phrases

Now we've got one phrase working, excellent! That's not enough for a phrasebook though, is it? Let's add some more phrases.

"Yes" and "No" are useful words to know in other languages, let's use the red cross to represent "No". Change the costume of the new sprite to Button5-b by clicking on the new sprite, selecting the Costumes tab (1) and then clicking the Choose a Costume button on the bottom left (2). Then delete the old costume by clicking it's "x" (3).

Finally, change "Where are the toilets?" to "No" in the no sprite's `translate`{:class="block3extensions"} code blocks. See the changes below:

![No sprite](images/noSmall.png)
```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
- say (translate (Where are the toilets?) to (language):: extension) for (2) secs
+ say (translate (No) to (language):: extension) for (2) secs

when this sprite clicked
- speak(translate(Where are the toilets?) to (language)::extension) ::extension
+ speak(translate(No) to (language)::extension) ::extension
```
