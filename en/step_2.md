Before you begin, take a moment to look around the Scratch 3.0 interface.

The biggest visual difference to Scratch 2.0 is that the Stage is now located on the right side of the window.

Some other changes include:
+ Sprite information is now always visible below the Stage
+ The blocks have an updated look
+ The Pen blocks are now in the Extensions section
