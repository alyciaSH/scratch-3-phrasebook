Before we begin, let's have a quick look at Scratch 3.0.

The biggest visual change from Scratch 2.0 is that the stage is now located on the right side of the screen.
Some other changes you might notice include:
+ Sprite information is now always visible below the stage.
+ Updated block designs
+ Pen blocks have been moved into the extensions section.

Let's start by creating the main backdrop. The first backdrop will contain flags to represent the languages we are using.
Use the button in the bottom right corner to choose a backdrop.

+ The magnifying glass let's you choose from Scratch's library of backdrops.
+ The paintbrush allows you to create your own backdrop.
+ The stars will choose a random backdrop from Scratch's library of backdrops.
+ The upload symbol can be used to upoad a picture and use it as the backdrop.
